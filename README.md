The VergeCurrency.com Official Website
==================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vergecurrency/vergecurrency.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vergecurrency/vergecurrency.com)

The VergeCurrency is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). In order to contribute a version of Ruby is required. It is encouraged to install Ruby using a Ruby version manager, like [RVM](https://github.com/rvm/rvm) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

### After installing Ruby
1. Make sure Rubygems is installed, this comes with RVM and rbenv by default.
2. `cd` into the project folder and run `bundle install`.
3. Now that the required gems are installed run the Jekyll webserver using `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### TODO:
1. add AMD gpu miner's to mining resource page / maybe add some links to tutorials
2. developer resource list, like the verge ruby, php, node.js, python, & c# wrappers
3. put chat back in radio page.
4. add translations of website - possibly google
5. add documentation on rpc commands and flags, for instance, some users might not know they can use a different drive to store their blockchain data using the --datadir=D:\whatever\drive\and\directory\they\want
